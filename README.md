XC -This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow."
% My name is Xavier Chaidez and I am currently training for my first triathlon. It is a little difficult training for the swimming portion of the event since we live in Tucson, AZ. It's lucky that Tucson is known for its vast amounts of bodies of water. If I am not training then I am likely working at the local migrant shelter where I work as a site lead. Come Visit!
